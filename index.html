    <h1>Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction</h1>
    <h1 id="unique"></h1>
    <p>This HIT is part of a scientific research project conducted by the University of Texas. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary, and your responses are anonymous. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings, published in scientific journals, or made publicly available to other researchers. Clicking on the 'Accept' button on the bottom of the page indicates that you are at least 18 years of age, you are a native English speaker, and you agree to complete the HIT voluntarily.<p>

    <p>You will be shown a series of airline passenger profiles and survey responses and asked to predict whether passenger was ultimately satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight. You will use information about the passenger's trip (travel class, reason for travel, etc.) and the passenger's survey responses on how they felt about various components of the flight to make your prediction decision. This prediction task is broken up into two stages. You will complete half of the tasks in the first stage. You will then be provided with additional information not available to you in the first stage. You will then be asked to make predictions for the remaining tasks.

    <h1>Consent Form</h1>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b><br>
        You are being asked to participate in a research study being conducted by researchers at the University of Texas system.  Participation is voluntary. The purpose of this research study is to help researchers develop AI-advising tools that can lead to better decision outcomes. 
</p>
<p><b>Procedures:</b><br>
If you choose to be in the study, you will be asked to complete a series of tasks. The experiment should take around 30-60 minutes to complete.
</p>
<p><b>Confidentiality:</b><br>
Your Mechanical Turk Worker ID will be used to distribute the payment to you, but we will not store your worker ID with your survey responses. Please be aware that your Mturk Workers ID can potentially be linked to information about you on your Amazon Public Profile page, however we will not access any personally identifying information from your Amazon Public Profile. Additionally, your MTurk worker IDs will NOT be shared with anyone. 
</p>
<p><b>What this study is about:</b><br>
This is a study about identifying which factors and concepts related to airline travel can be used to predict airline passenger satisfaction. The goal is to accurately predict whether airline passengers would be satisfied with their journeys given information about their specific flight experiences. 
</p>
<p><b>What we will ask you to do:</b><br>
This study will be divided into several components. First, you will then be introduced via a tutorial to the airline passenger satisfaction prediction task. The tutorial will describe the prediction goal and all factors/features that will be available to you with definitions. After the tutorial you will be asked to answer a series of questions about the content in the tutorial page to confirm you understood the tutorial. You will then move on to the prediction task during which you will be shown a series of passenger profiles and asked to predict whether the passenger was ultimately satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight. The passenger's ultimate (dis)satisfaction with their flight has a ground truth response that was provided by the passenger but will not be revealed to you until after the end of the experiment. Therefore, there is a correct answer for each task that you will be predicting. After the first round of questions, you will have a short break and will be provided with information on how you did over the first set of questions. You will then be asked to answer another set of questions, just like in the previous round. Finally, you will be asked to answer some more demographic and survey style questions describing your experience with the experiment. 
</p>
<p><b>Costs/Payments:</b><br>
This study will pay $7.25/hour. MTurk worker IDs will be collected for the purposes of distributing compensation. You will be provided with additional incentive compensation dependent on how many of the tasks you answer correctly, at a rate of $0.02 per correct task answer. Additionally, you will receieve a bonus of $0.50 for completing the study in its entirety.
</p>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE: This study contains a number of attention checks to make sure that participants are finishing the tasks honestly and completely. As long as you read the instructions and complete the tasks in good faith, your HIT will be approved. If you fail the attention checks, your HIT will be rejected. </b></p>
<p><b>Disclaimer: </b><br>
Any work performed on MTurk can be linked to the user’s public profile page. Thus, workers may wish to restrict what information they choose to share in their public profile.

<p><b>If you have questions:</b><br>
The main researcher conducting this study is Maytal Saar-Tsechansky, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. If you have questions about this study, you may contact Professor Maytal Saar-Tsechansky at Maytal.Saar-Tsechansky@mccombs.utexas.edu.

      <p>Question 2: Your final prediction of whether the passenger was ultimately satisfied with their airline experience will be compared to the true answer provided by the passenger, and you will be rewarded an additional $0.02 for prediction that is correct (matches the passenger's response)?</p>

    <h1>Part 1 Task Instructions</h1>
    <p>You will be shown a series of airline passenger satisfaction survey responses filled out by airline passengers after they completed a flight. Each passenger rated their satisfaction of several flight related factors on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least satisfied and 5 being most satisfied). Along with each passenger's survey responses, you will have access to basic passenger information such as their age, the class they flew in, their airline loyalty status, the amount of time they flew, and whether they experienced delays on the flight. Given this information about each passenger, your task is to predict how the passenger responsed to the question: "How satisfied were you with the flight overall?" Your job is to predict whether each passenger responded to this question with "satisfied" or "dissatisfied." The true overall satisfaction is known but hidden and will be revealed to you once you complete the series of tasks. For each task, if you correctly predict the passenger's satisfaction, you will earn an additional $0.02. </p>

    
    <p>For each passenger, you will have access to the following factors: </p>
    <p><small><em>
Gender: Gender of the passengers (Female, Male)<br>
Customer Type: The customer type (Loyal customer, disloyal customer)<br>
Age: The actual age of the passengers<br>
Type of Travel: Purpose of the flight of the passenger (Personal Travel, Business Travel)<br>
Class: Travel class in the plane of the passenger (Business, Eco, Eco Plus)<br>
Flight distance: The flight distance of this journey<br>
Arrival Delay in Minutes: Minutes delayed when Arrival.<br>
Departure Delay in Minutes: Minutes delayed when departure<br></small></em><br>
You will also have access to the passenger's survey responses indicating their satisfaction regarding the following aspects of their flight: <br><br>
<small><em></em>&ensp;Inflight wifi service<br>
&ensp;Convenience of Departure/Arrival time<br>
&ensp;Ease of Online booking<br>
&ensp;Gate location<br>
&ensp;Food and drink<br>
&ensp;Seat comfort<br>
&ensp;Inflight entertainment<br>
